# Pothole-detection-system
Website that detects potholes from videos and updates them on the map, notifying users about the same.

An intelligent road defect detection system powered by deep learning that automatically identifies potholes, cracks, and surface irregularities from video footage.

# Overview
Road safety and maintenance are critical challenges in modern urban infrastructure. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision technologies to automate the detection of road defects, making road maintenance more efficient and improving driver safety.
The system uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to identify potholes and road surface irregularities from video footage, providing real-time analysis, GPS mapping, and instant notifications.
